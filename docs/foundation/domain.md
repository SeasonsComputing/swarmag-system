# swarmAg System – Domain

This document defines the foundational abstractions, contracts, and APIs of the swarmAg Operations System, or
 the `swarmAg System`. The domain model captures both the problem space and the solution space, expressed as classes, types, interfaces, associations, and APIs delivered through a TypeScript library.

## 1. Domain Model (`source/domain`)

### 1.1 Scope

Define the TypeScript domain library described in `architecture.md`, limited to types and associations under `source/domain` plus shared primitives in `source/utils`. All other concerns (API, persistence, UI) consume these types rather than re-declaring them.

### 1.2 Core abstractions that define the solution space

| Abstraction     | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Service`       | Offering provided to customers              |
| `Asset`         | Equipment/resources used in operations      |
| `Chemical`      | Materials applied within services           |
| `Workflow`      | Sequenced steps for delivering a service    |
| `JobAssessment` | Initial evaluation of a prospective job     |
| `JobPlan`       | Planned execution details for a job         |
| `JobLog`        | Append-only record of job events and states |
| `Customer`      | Organization purchasing services            |
| `Contact`       | Individual associated with a customer       |

### 1.3 Common abstractions shared within the model

| Abstraction  | Description                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `User`       | Identity/profile with role memberships and contact info                 |
| `Author`     | Lightweight attribution slice of `User` with a curated attribution role |
| `Note`       | Freeform text with author/time                                          |
| `Attachment` | File reference metadata and uploader                                    |
| `Address`    | Postal address fields                                                   |
| `Location`   | Coordinate plus optional address                                        |
| `Coordinate` | Latitude/longitude pair                                                 |
| `Question`   | Prompt used in assessments/forms                                        |
| `Answer`     | Response to a question                                                  |

### 1.4 Supporting structures present in code (refer to type definitions for details)

| Area      | Structures / Notes                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Services  | `sku`; `requiredAssetTypes: ID[]` (links to AssetType)    |
| Assets    | `AssetType` (`id`, `name`; lifecycle aligned to Services) |
| Workflows | `WorkflowStep`, `WorkflowVersion`                         |
| Jobs      | `JobAssignment`, `JobChemicalPlan`                        |
| Customers | `CustomerSite`                                            |

### 1.5 Utility data types

| Type   | Description                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| `ID`   | UUID v7 string identifier        |
| `When` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp as string |

### 1.6 Rules

- Language: TypeScript (strict mode) using the root `tsconfig.json` settings (`module: ESNext`, `moduleResolution: bundler`, `baseUrl: "source"`).
- Use the configured path aliases when importing: `@domain/*` for domain modules, `@utils/*` for core utilities.
- Types must be JSON-serializable.
- No runtime dependencies beyond the UUID helper (or a tiny internal implementation).
- This package is the **single source of truth** for domain types.
- All other code (apps, functions) must import from `source/domain`.
- Asset types are modeled as data records (`AssetType`) and referenced by `Asset.type` and `Service.requiredAssetTypes`; keep the canonical list in `docs/foundation/data-lists.md`.
- Attachments carry a `kind` (`photo` | `video` | `map` | `document`).
- `Customer.contacts` is non-empty and `primaryContactId` lives on `Customer`.
- Locations store coordinates/addresses without a `source` field.
- JobAssessments must capture one or more `Location` entries (`locations` tuple) to support noncontiguous ranch assessments.
- Soft deletes: abstractions that need logical deletion (starting with `User`) expose `deletedAt?: When`; callers treat undefined/null as active, filter queries to `deleted_at IS NULL`, and keep partial unique indexes on active rows so identifiers can be reused after delete.
- ID strategy: UUID v7 for PK/FK to avoid an ID service, allow offline/preassigned keys, and let related rows be inserted together; mitigations include using the native `uuid` type, a v7 generator, avoiding redundant indexes, preferring composite keys for pure join tables, and routine maintenance (vacuum/reindex) on heavy-write tables.

### 1.7 Roles & attribution

- User memberships are constrained to `USER_ROLES` (`administrator`, `sales`, `operations`) defined in `source/domain/common.ts`; `User.roles` is an array so a user may hold multiple memberships.
- Attribution uses curated roles, not free text: `AUTHOR_ATTRIBUTION_ROLES` in `source/domain/common.ts` lists role ids/labels and the contexts they apply to (e.g., `assessment-lead`, `crew-lead`, `gis-analyst`, `field-tech`, `fleet-manager`, `account-executive`).
- `Author.role` stores the attribution role id from `AUTHOR_ATTRIBUTION_ROLES`; UI should render the label from that catalog and never collect arbitrary text.
- If a context does not supply a meaningful attribution role, omit it rather than prompting the user for input.
